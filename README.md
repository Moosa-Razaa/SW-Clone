# SW-Clone

## **Project Overview**  
This project aims to build a **SplitWise-like app** using **Microservices** architecture with a **Go** backend and a **React Native** frontend. The app will help users manage group expenses, split bills, track payments, and more. Features include user authentication, expense management, notifications, and more.

## **Features**

- **Frontend:** 5 Credit Points  
- **Description:** Users can create and manage groups, add members, and track expenses for each group. Groups can be public or private.

### **3. Add Expenses (Title, Amount, Category, Date, Receipt Image, Individual Items, Location)**  
- **Backend:** 7 Credit Points  
- **Frontend:** 6 Credit Points  
- **Description:** Users can add expenses with details like title, amount, category, date, and an image of the receipt. Users can add individual items of the expense, and it can be tagged with the expenseâ€™s location.

### **4. Split Expenses (Equally, Custom Shares, Percentages, Divide Individual Items)**  
- **Backend:** 6 Credit Points

### **5. Expense History (Track Past Expenses with Filters and Graphs)**  
- **Backend:** 6 Credit Points  
- **Frontend:** 7 Credit Points  
- **Description:** Users can track past expenses with filters (by date, category, group, etc.). Graphs can be used for visual representation of the expenses.

### **6. Settle Balances (Mark Payments as Settled)**  
- **Backend:** 5 Credit Points  
- **Frontend:** 5 Credit Points  
- **Description:** Users can mark transactions as settled and keep track of paid and unpaid balances.

### **7. OCR for Receipt Parsing (Extract Text from Images)**  
- **Backend:** 8 Credit Points  
- **Frontend:** 6 Credit Points  
- **Description:** Users can upload receipt images, and the app will automatically extract text (e.g., amount, date, vendor) using OCR.

### **8. Expense Classification (Categorize Expenses: Breakfast, Lunch, etc.)**  
- **Backend:** 8 Credit Points  
- **Frontend:** 7 Credit Points  
- **Description:** The app automatically classifies expenses into predefined categories (e.g., "Breakfast," "Cosmetic"). Users can also create custom groups (e.g., "Food," "Entertainment").

### **9. Push Notifications (Reminders for Pending Settlements)**  
- **Backend:** 5 Credit Points  
- **Frontend:** 6 Credit Points  
- **Description:** Send push notifications for pending settlements, new expenses, or updates on group activities.

### **10. Multi-Currency Support (Convert Expenses to Default Currency)**  
- **Backend:** 7 Credit Points  
- **Frontend:** 6 Credit Points  
- **Description:** Users can view expenses in their preferred currency, with real-time currency conversion using APIs.

### **11. Export Reports (PDF/CSV Export for Tracking Expenses)**  
- **Backend:** 6 Credit Points  
- **Frontend:** 5 Credit Points  
- **Description:** Users can export their expense history in PDF or CSV formats with filters (e.g., date range, category).

### **12. Recurring Expenses (Auto-Split Monthly Bills)**  
- **Backend:** 7 Credit Points  
- **Frontend:** 6 Credit Points  
- **Description:** Users can create recurring expenses (e.g., subscriptions), and the app will automatically add them to the expense list on a regular basis (daily, weekly, monthly).
